# Medjed Assembly

This repository contains the CAD files and assembly of the [MEDJED Maskless lithography system](https://github.com/openMLA/Medjed). CAD files are generated with FreeCAD.

Note that the [Wiki](https://github.com/openMLA/Medjed/wiki) and [Discussions](https://github.com/openMLA/Medjed/discussions) for the project are located in the main Medjed repository.

### Organisation

This repository should generally be obtained as a submodule of the main Medjed repository. That other repository will also have code and PCB designs for the project. 

The binary files are managed through [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/). When you first clone this repository these files will not have been downloaded, so you will see the history of the files, but not be able to open them.
